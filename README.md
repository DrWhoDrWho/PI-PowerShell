# PI-PowerShell

## About
This repository will hold working examples of using PowerShell to interact with the OSIsoft PI System through the OSIsoft.PowerShell library for PowerShell.
The intent is that the examples will include features that one would expect to see in commercial applications in an OT (Operations Technology) environment. For example, the PowerShell script will write to PI Points which will allow monitoring and alerting in the case that the application does not update the PI point for some time.
